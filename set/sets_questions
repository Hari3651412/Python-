# Sets Practice Questions

# 1. Create a set named `fruits` with values: "apple", "banana", "cherry".
Fruits={"apple","banana", "cherry"}
Print(Fruits)

# 2. Add a new item "mango" to the `fruits` set.
new_item=Fruits.add("mango")
Print(new_item)

# 3. Try to add "banana" again to the set. What happens?
it will not print duplicates

# 4. Remove "apple" from the set using the remove() method.
Fruits.remove("apple")
print(Fruits)

# 5. Use discard() to remove "grape" from the set (which does not exist). Does it raise an error?
it will raise an error grape elementis not found in the set

# 6. Create two sets:
#    a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
#    b = {3, 4, 5, 6}
#    Find their union.
print(a || b)


# 7. Find the intersection of sets `a` and `b`.
print(a & b)


# 8. Find the difference between sets `a` and `b` (elements in a not in b).
print(a-b)

# 9. Find the symmetric difference between `a` and `b`.
print(a -b)

# 10. Check if sets {1, 2} is a subset of {1, 2, 3, 4}.

print(a.issubset(b))

# 11. Check if {1, 2, 3, 4} is a superset of {2, 3}.
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {2, 3}

print(set1.issuperset(set2))

# 12. Check if sets {1, 2} and {3, 4} are disjoint (no common elements).
set1 = {1, 2}
set2 = {3, 4}

print(set1.isdisjoint(set2))

# 13. Use the pop() method on a set and print the removed value.
fruits.pop()

# 14. Use the clear() method to empty a set and then print it.

# 15. Convert the list [1, 2, 2, 3, 4] into a set and explain what happens to duplicates.
lst=[1,2,3,4,2]
newlst=set(lst)
print(newlst)
