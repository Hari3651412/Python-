# List Methods & Slicing Practice Questions

# 1. Create a list named 'fruits' containing: ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
fruits=["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
# 2. Add "fig" to the end of the 'fruits' list.
fruits.append("fig")
print(fruits)

# 3. Insert "blueberry" at index 2 in the 'fruits' list.
fruits.insert(2,"blueberry")
print(fruits)

# 4. Remove "date" from the list using a list method.
fruits.remove("date")
print("fruits")

# 5. Pop the last item from the list and print it.
fruits.pop(-1)
print(fruits)

# 6. Use slicing to get the first three fruits from the list.
print(fruits[:3])

# 7. Use slicing to get every second fruit from the list.


# 8. Use slicing with a negative step to reverse the list.

# 15. Combine the following two lists into a new list using a list method:
